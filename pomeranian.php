        <p class="leading-relaxed">Descended from large sled dog breeds, the now-tiny Pomeranian has a long and interesting history. The foxy-faced dog, nicknamed “the little dog who thinks he can,” is compact, active, and capable of competing in agility and obedience or simply being a family friend.Even though these are purebred dogs, you may
          find them in the care of shelters or rescue groups. Remember to adopt! Don’t shop if you want to bring a dog home.Poms may be small, but they don’t always act that way and may even challenge larger dogs. While they make for good apartment pets, they can also bark a lot, which your neighbors may not be too thrilled about. But as long
          as you give your dog plenty of exercise and playtime, keep them out of hot weather, and give them lots of love and attention, you’ll have a loving, adorable, furry family companion!</p>
