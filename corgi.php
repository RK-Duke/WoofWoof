        <p class="leading-relaxed">Originally bred to herd cattle, sheep, and horses, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi is an active and intelligent dog breed. Easy to train and eager to learn,
          Pembrokes are great with children and other pets, and you can find them in four different coat colors and markings.
          Even though these are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of shelters or rescue groups. Remember to adopt! Don’t shop if you want to bring a dog home.
          Adaptable and loving with the whole family, Corgis can fit into just about any household, whether it’s an apartment or large home with a yard. However, they do
          have quite a bit of energy for a small dog. They’ll need plenty of walks and active play sessions. You might be surprised by how quickly these short-legged pups can move! For humans who can meet the breed’s needs, the Pembroke will make an excellent family companion, even for novice pet parents.</p>
